# Lacerater - Terminal Application
## Statement of Purpose & Scope
###### 300 - 500 words:
###### Describe - what the app will do.
This app, dubbed Lacerater, will use HTTP Request methods to acquire data and information from any website. It runs only in the terminal, in that the only interface is the command line arguments, flags, and options. It will produce output to the terminal window that can be piped to other apps or methods in the terminal as well as produce an output file if the user includes that option when the command is run. 
It is designed to be simple and in future branches extensible.
##### Identify - the problem it will solve
It will automate some of the most rudimentary browser-based inspection and information gathering techniques of ethical hackers during their initial analysis of a web application.
##### Identify - the target audience
Cyber security analysts who are working in the unix terminal, grepping, vimming, and bashing data for reports with the intent of later performing deeper analysis of client web services.
