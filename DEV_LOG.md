# Assessment 1 Terminal App Developer Logs
## Entry 1 - 2019 7 1
### personal notes:
It has been difficult to motivate the creation of this app or its documentation. The primary difficulty has been in finding meaning from the coding in this case and the surrounding activities. Am I past the stage in my life and in my coding abilities that pointless open-ended coding is stimulating or am I just struggling with it for personal reasons? I remember my last client, Francis, when I was in Asia contracting my knowledge of elearning technologies and techniques, he complained several times about my ability to deliver efficiently on project milestones. 
Francis did it with a warmth though, he was very kind to me. Nonetheless, he was absolutely right, in recent years I have lost the drive to make my own meaning out of tasks - it all feels like busy work although I know it isn't. The same plagues me now about this assignment, however, I will not take all the burden. Every day over the last two weeks I feel alone in a crowd, my attention pointed nowhere special. I'm uncertain if I am rising up to this bootcamp. The pretense needs to strip away and the work emerge. It may be emotions in the way, fewer moments are distracting me from that.
### notes about code (still quite reflective and personal):
The purpose of the app is to pretend to be doing something exciting and hacker-ish. It most certainly isn't. So I will take it upon myself to play with some modules to do things that look cool to people who know nothing about hacking. That is the real target audience of this program; a teenager with a delusion of having a hollywood audience, or perhaps a student film-maker who has to put some toothless hacking activities into her script.

The procrastination is getting brutal. There appears no way to find urgency, and I can feel my mind putting it off until the rush of Saturday afternoon to finalize the product. Looking for my developer groove in all the wrong places. Crashing and burning alone as usual, god damn drama.

Why can't I just go through, concentrate on the development and produce the work.. This feels like doctors and nurses.
